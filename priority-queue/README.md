Definition: the [Priority-Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) data structure associates a key to a value. An appropriate data type in such an environment supports two operations: remove the maximum and insert. Such a data type is called a priority queue. Using priority
queues is similar to using queues (remove the oldest) and stacks (remove the newest), but implementing them efficiently is more challenging.
