Collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Python and C++. For an optimal learning experience it is recommended to study the material in the following order:

1. **Disjoint-set**: (data structure) [[link]](./disjoint-set)

2. **Stack**: (abstract data structure) [[link]](./stack)

3. **Queue**: (abstract data structure) [[link]](./queue)

4. **Elementary sort**: (sorting algorithm) TBD [selection sort, insertion sort, shellsort]

5. **Mergesort**: (sorting algorithm) [[link]](./mergesort)

6. **Quicksort**: (sorting algorithm) [[link]](./quicksort)

7. **Priority-Queue**: (data structure) similarly to a Queue it stores an array of values, but when `pop()` is called the largest value (higher priority) is returned [[link]](./priority-queue)

8. **Symbol Tables**: (data structure) the primary purpose is to associate a key to a value. The best standard implementation is based on ordered arrays and has O(log N) time complexity for `get()` and O(N) time complexity for `put()` [[link]](./symbol-tables)

9. **Binary Search Trees**: (data structure) it is a smart implementation of symbol tables. It solves the problem given by the standard symbol table implementations, giving O(log N) time complexity for both `get()` and `put()`. [[link]](./binary-search-trees)

10. **Balanced Search Trees**: (data structure) it solves the problem of unbalanced trees, given by . It is also known as [self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree) 

11. **Red-Black Balanced Search Trees**: (data structure) TBD

12. **Hash tables**: (data structure) TBD
